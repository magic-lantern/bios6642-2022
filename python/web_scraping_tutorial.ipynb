    "Why web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many experts have proposed that 80% of a machine learning/AI project is spent on data gathering and preparation, with 20% spent on training a model. For more on this topic, watch Dr. Andrew Ng's presention on data centric AI availble at https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently the topic of web scraping has been in the news as a high profile case has been working its way through the US legal system. Automated scraping of publicly available information is legal: https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/ as affirmed in the various trials of LinkedIn v Hiq Labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data gathering is hard. If you can re-use data gathered by someone else, it can make your project possible. Note, reusing data collected for another purpose will still be hard and require quite a bit of data preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The best tool to use is the one you already know.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has functionality that allows one to read in data from a variety of sources. Some include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* comma separated value or tab separated value files\n",
    "* databases (anything supported by SQLAlchemy)\n",
    "* web pages (finds all HTML tables)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.\n",
